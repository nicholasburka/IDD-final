## Big Idea

We have a batch of old cell phones one of our team members purchased from a cell phone repair store that was going out of business (to convert to a music studio). We’d like to “revive” these, by using them as augmented displays and touchscreens for regular computer use. We hope to answer the questions: What typical HCI experiences would be enhanced by an additional, smaller screen? How can using the phone’s touch display augment the user experience?

We’ve thought of several potential use cases, scaling in anticipated complexity. Firstly, an additional display could hold “sticky notes”, like helpful reminders and daily motivational quotes. The music recording experience could benefit from a mobile terminal to perform simple recording functions (start recording, switch tracks, move the playback back and forwards).


## Parts Needed
Batch of old phones to test (already have)
Cables to charge phones and connect them to computer (already have, micro USB/USB-C/iPhone)
